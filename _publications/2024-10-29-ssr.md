**Abstract**

This study investigates the mediation effect of conservative political ideology on the relation- Evangelical identity
ship between Evangelical identities and attitudes against the mask mandate during COVID-19 in P Mask mandate
the U.S., using a nationally representative survey administered over three waves from Septem- COVID-19
ber 2020 to June 2021. We employ a moderated mediation analysis to examine the pathway Political conservatism
from Evangelical identity to political conservativeness to anti-mask-mandate attitudes, and the Education
Moderated mediation interaction effect between years of education and political ideology. A logistic regression model 
is used to investigate each path in the mediation analysis. Results suggest that controlling for socio-demographic 
background, self-identified Evangelical status positively drives resistance to the mask mandate. Additional findings 
confirm that political orientation is not only an estab- lished predictor of the polarized public support of masking, 
as found in existing studies, but is E also a key mechanism by which Evangelical identities positively predict anti-mask-mask 
attitudes. Finally, a higher level of education is associated with greater political polarization of pub- lic opinions on the 
mask mandate during the pandemic.
